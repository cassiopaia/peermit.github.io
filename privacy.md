Site related activities. Much of the personal identification
information we gather is required in order for us to remain compliant
with relevant state and federal laws.  We do not collect, store or have
access to any social media profile passwords Users may use to login to
our site. If a User logs in with a social media profile we cannot gather

permissions via the standard social media interface protocol. Despite
User permission, we are only able gather basic data, including, but not
limited to, name, gender, friend list and tweets (depending on the type
of social media). If we require more information we will seek User
permission first via the standard protocol. We will not have access to
the User's alternative social media profiles in such a way that we could
make posts for the User or conduct standard user activities for the
User.
